# TT CHAMPIONS

I have three kids. They are always competing to impress me with their knowledge of times table. They award themselves additional kudos with the speed with which they can answer a problem. I'm tired of them arguing over who is the undisputed times tables "CHAMPION" so I'm writing a little program to determine this once and for all.
